## üîë Environment Variables

To keep sensitive information secure, the API key for the OMDb API is stored in environment variables.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following line to store your API key:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. Make sure you don't commit the `.env` file by adding it to `.gitignore`.

For deployment on **Vercel**, set the `REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY` environment variable in your Vercel project settings under **Environment Variables**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Movie Search**: The app allows users to search for movies by title. It fetches data from the OMDb API.
2. **Movie Details**: Clicking on a movie shows more details such as runtime, genre, director, and IMDb rating.
3. **Add to Watched**: Users can rate movies using stars, and if the rating is set, they can add the movie to their "watched list".
4. **Average Rating**: The app calculates the average IMDb rating for all movies in the "watched list".
